# SimpleFabric

The purpose of this project is to try to create a _simple_ implementation of an _API_ that approximates Microsoft Service Fabric, allowing you to use a similar _programming model_ without necessarily giving you any benefits of scalability reliability, resilience, delivery guarantees, etc.

The idea is to make a platform where you can start out developing a throwaway project that is a runaway hit, which in turn makes it easy to move (code and data-wise) to a platform that is highly scalable and resilient.
